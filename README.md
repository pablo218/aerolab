# Aerolab Challenge

Hi! thanks for the oportunity to develop this beautiful and challenging desing, There were a lot of details that made the challenge very exiting.
I wish I would have more real time to compleated but regardless the result I really enjoyed work on it

Greetings!

## Run the APP

To run this app on local eviroment:
-Add .env.local file with the following environment variables:
REACT_APP_BASE_URL (base url of the chalenge)
REACT_APP_TOKEN (a valid api token)
-Add node modules (npn install).
-Run NPM start

### Some considerations

-I used React JS framework
-I implent i18next with te intention to apply some "swicth languaje" function, but I dont't have time.
-I didnÂ´t have enough time to create a mobile version but I made a tablet version-
-For the UI I used pure CSS with SASS
-you can visit the web app in the following addresses:
REMEBER: Only the tablet and desktop version are ready, but yo can see the app in a mobile Phone if you turn the browser to desktop mode.
